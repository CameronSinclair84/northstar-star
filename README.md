Recreating the Star functionality from NorthStar

On a recent client project for NorthStar, as well as working on and having input into most areas of the project, I led the development and implementation of the "Star" functionality. This uses a ChartJS Radar Chart component to plot and display the results from questionnaires completed by the user.

The user can switch between questionnaire results showing different stars. The user can also customize the appearance of the star component. In this demo implementation I also allow the user to display multiple datasets at once.
